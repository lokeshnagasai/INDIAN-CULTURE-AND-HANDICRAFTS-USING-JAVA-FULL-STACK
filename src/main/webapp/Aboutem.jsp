<h1>India is a place where colour is doubly bright. Pinks that scald your eyes, blues you could drown in.</h1>
<h3> &#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;	Indian culture is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, 
artifacts and technologies that originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse India. The term also applies
 beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, 
 particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from 
 place to place within the country.</h3>

<h3> &#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;	India is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse nations in the world, with some of the most deeply religious 
societies and cultures. Religion plays a central and definitive role in the life of many of its people. Although India is a 
secular Hindu-majority country, it has a large Muslim population. Except for Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Meghalaya, 
Nagaland, Mizoram and Lakshadweep, Hindus form the predominant population in all 27 states and 9 union territories. 
Muslims are present throughout India, with large populations in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, 
West Bengal and Assam; while only Jammu and Kashmir and Lakshadweep have majority Muslim populations. Christians are other significant minorities of India.</h3>
<h3>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;	Religion in India is characterised by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices. The Indian subcontinent is the birthplace of four of 
the world's major religions; namely Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. The preamble of Indian constitution states that India is a secular state.
Throughout India's history, religion has been an important part of the country's culture. Religious diversity and religious tolerance are both established 
in the country by the law; the Constitution of India has declared the right to freedom of religion to be a fundamental right.</h3>
